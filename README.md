# ping_comming_soon
Project by Frontend Mentor | responsivnes | email validation | flexbox

## overview

### the challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## my process

### built with
semantic html5 markup
css custom properties
flexbox
mobile-first flow
google fonts
fontawesome.com
JS DOM

## what I learned
"outline: none;" - turns off the unnecessary outline of the input;
"transition: .3s;" - makes smooth color's transition;
you can change the border color in js by "document.getElementById("email").style.border = "1px solid red";"
